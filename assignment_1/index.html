        <p>In 1965, Wiley discovered, and eventually bought, an odd wooden object resembling a step stool in a Mill
            Valley thrift store. Wiley and his student Bruce Nauman treated it as both a muse from which to take
            inspiration and a subject in need of a biography. The Slant Steps on view here were made during that first
            moment of excitement around the mysterious object. </p>

        <p>Early in his career, Wiley created intimate objects that reveal a restless artist. He also rendered in
            different styles, trying flat graphic representations (Relections on Egypt, 1964, shown below), delicate
            graphite feathering (Yang Yen, 1965) and muted surrealism (Modern Art Teacher). Wiley's work in these years
            is replete with pyramids, the rhinoceros and the enigmatic question mark.</p>
